You are organizing Minecraft block texture files. I need you to categorize these {len(filenames)} texture filenames into a JSON structure.

Each block should be organized like this:
{{
    "block_name": "Readable Block Name",
    "textures": {{
        "front": "filename.png" (if applicable),
        "back": "filename.png" (if applicable),
        "left": "filename.png" (if applicable),
        "right": "filename.png" (if applicable),
        "sides": "filename.png" (if applicable - for textures used on multiple sides),
        "top": "filename.png" (if applicable),
        "bottom": "filename.png" (if applicable),
        "all": "filename.png" (if same texture used for all faces),
        "other": "filename.png" (for special variants like powered, lit, etc.)
    }}
}}

Rules:
1. Group related textures by block type (e.g., all acacia door textures go together)
2. Use descriptive block names (e.g., "Acacia Door" not "acacia_door")
3. Only include texture properties that actually apply to each file
4. If a texture doesn't clearly fit a face type, use "other"
5. If multiple files exist for the same block, group them appropriately
6. Return ONLY valid JSON, no other text

Files to categorize:
{', '.join(filenames)}

Return the JSON structure:
